# Wolf-Pack Game

## Overview

This is a game based on the JQuery classic "Crystal Collector".  Instead of collecting crystals and receving points, the user takes drinks and either awards him or herself with a early morning yoga class or is punished by receiving a brutal hang over.  The game was styled to be set in Vegas where one is apt to drink more than one should and not attend morning yoga.  Avoiding a hangover in Vegas is surely an accomplishment so the user deserves a win!
